# Phaser MMORPG User Authentication with MongoDB
This is an API that allows new players to signup for our MMORPG game. A player can also verify that the API is up using the check status endpoint which will
return a 200 if the route is still up and running. We will be using token authentication to keep a persistant login and logout feature that allows a player 
to stay logged in without the need to login everytime.

# Routes:
    - 404 handler
    - 500 handerl
    - status
    - signup
    - login
    - logout
    - token 
    - forgot password
    - reset password
